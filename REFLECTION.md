REFLECTION



1. What was the most helpful aspect of this code’s structure?

The most helpful part of this code was the way the data was organized in an array of objects. Each reading entry used the same structure, which made it clear how the functions accessed and processed the information. Dividing the logic into separate functions also improved the readability and made the code easier to follow.



2\. What part was confusing or took longer to understand?

The part that took longer to understand was the code that used loops, arrays, and objects together because I had to track how data moved between them. In the most-read-book function, the loop iterates over each reading entry and updates an object that keeps track of each book. Writing comments helped me make the logic easier to follow step by step and understand how the values were stored and updated.
